This NMF script performs Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on RNA-Seq gene expression data to identify molecular clusters (subtypes) of patients and genes. 
It explores how clustering changes with different values of K (number of clusters) and visualizes transitions using alluvial plots. 
The script also computes the cophenetic correlation coefficient to evaluate cluster stability.

the Consensus_matrix file creates the cosensus matrices on the 10 K (clusters) created in NMF
